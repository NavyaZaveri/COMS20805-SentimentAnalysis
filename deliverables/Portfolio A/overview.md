# Overview
Our client is Ghyston, a bespoke software development company based in Bristol.

In the process of developing software, Ghyston use a range of open source tools including languages, libraries and frameworks. The problem they face is determining which pieces of software to use. One metric used when deciding is their popularity, since this tells them if other usersâ€™ experiences with the software were positive or negative. Sites such as GitHub have existing ratings which can be used to rank the most starred repositories, but this does not tell the whole story. A solution to this problem would be a tool that looks for posts on social media about that particular piece of software and extracts a sentiment value from these. An aggregate sentiment of the posts would be a good estimate of an open source project's real value in the eyes of the developer community and would help our client in choosing which software to use in their projects.
