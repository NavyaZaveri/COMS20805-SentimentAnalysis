# Overview

In todays technology driven world, social media sites such as Twitter and Reddit, have become one of the  prominent platforms to raise one's opinion and influence advertising on a large scale.

Our client Ghyston, is a bespoke software development company based in Bristol,use a range of open source tools including languages, libraries and frameworks, for developing software. The problem they face is determining which pieces of software to use. One metric used when deciding is their popularity, since this tells them if other users experiences with the software were positive or negative. Sites such as GitHub have existing ratings which can be used to rank the most starred repositories, but this does not tell the whole story.

A solution to this problem would be a tool that looks for posts on social media about that particular piece of software and extracts a sentiment value from these. An aggregate sentiment of the posts would be extremely useful in social media monitoring as it allows us to gain a better synopsis of the wider public opinion behind certain topics in software and provide an open source project's real value in the eyes of the developer community and help our client in choosing which software to use in their projects
