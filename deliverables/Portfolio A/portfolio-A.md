# Overview
Our client is Ghyston, a Bristol based software consultancy.

In the process of developing software our client uses a lot of open source tools, i.e. languages, libraries, etc. The problem is determining which pieces of software to use. Existing ratings on, for example, Github may not tell the whole story. A possible solution to this problem could be a tool that looks for posts about that particular piece of software on the Internet and extracts a sentiment value from these. The aggregate sentiment of posts could be a good estimate of an open source project's real value in the eyes of the developer community.
