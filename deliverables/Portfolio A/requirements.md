1. The software will be able to extract insights from social media posts related to technology.
2. It must display an overall rating of a query given by the user.
3. It must display a list of up to 10 related posts for every successful query. If there are fewer than 10 posts, the front end will display all posts related to its respected query.
4. When a malformed query is provided *fuzzy matching* will take place.
* The algorithm will find correspondences between segments of a text and entries in our database of previous translations.
5. Our rest API should be *idempotent*.
  * Our algorithm can be applied multiple times without affecting the result beyond initial application.
6. Database will be updated at least once a week.
* The development team will be responsible for maintaining and updating the system, with new posts.
7. The application uses the Elastic search engine to

## Non-functional Requirements
1. **Performance**: The software shall be able to handle up to 36 requests per second
  * Rough estimate of requests per second (at peak times)
    * 4.7 million developers in Europe
    * Each making 20 requests
    * Let's assume they all access our website in the same 2 hour period

2. **Legislative**: The software shall be released under the MIT licence.
3. **Usability**: We aim to make our software as usable as possible by testing on its:
*  ***Time-on-task***
* ***Success-rate***
*  ***Efficiency***: This will be tested through unit and system integration tests, to ensure our product delivers the result as fast as possible.
 * ***Memorability***: When a user returns to the application after a period of not using it, the user shall remember enough to use it effectively the next time.

  * We will be testing this by showing our product to a small sample of users and observing how they interact with it. Users will be asked for feedback via a questionnaire*.
